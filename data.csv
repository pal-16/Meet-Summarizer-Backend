First, she was a rare female executive at the helm of a major tech company. Since then, people have been similarly interested in what would come after she departed Yahoo following its sale to Verizon in 2017. On Wednesday, Mayer announced that her secretive startup Lumi Labs -- which she cofounded in 2018 with Enrique Muñoz Torres, who also worked at Yahoo and Google (GOOG) -- has been rebranded as Sunshine and has its first product: Sunshine Contacts.  Sunshine Contacts is an app that aims to help organize and improve one's iPhone contact list using technology it develops, such as artificial intelligence. (The app is currently invite only. An Android app is in the works, according to Fast Company.) In part, Sunshine Contacts just cleans things up by correcting spelling errors and getting rid of duplicate contact entries. More sophisticated features promise to provide updated context about contacts when reaching out to them, such as surfacing the most recent correspondence so it's top of mind. Sunshine is expected to launch a suite of services in addition to Sunshine Contacts. Mayer, who serves as CEO, said in a statement that ""essential technologies that help us stay connected to those who matter most are antiquated. ""They've been around forever and we all see them as 'good enough,' despite their outsized impact on our interactions and relationships. At Sunshine, we believe there's an immense opportunity to make the mundane magical,"" said Mayer, whose company has raised more than $20 million in venture capital to date. ""It's been an extremely challenging and rewarding problem to tackle and we're just getting started."" Mayer, Google's 20th employee, is credited with the success of many of its most famous products and oversaw important launches, including Gmail and Google Maps. She's said to have introduced over 100 products and features while at Google.  Mayer's time at Yahoo, however, was less lauded. She was viewed as the company's best hope at maintaining relevance, and under her leadership, Yahoo spent billions acquiring companies including blog startup Tumblr, which it has since sold. Mayer also attracted big names like journalist Katie Couric, but ultimately, she was unable to turn around Yahoo in her five years leading the business. "
1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/success/honda-civic-unveiled-twitch/index.html,Honda unveils its new Civic on Twitch to attract younger buyers,"The Civic, with its affordable price tag, good fuel economy and excellent safety ratings, has been the best-selling passenger car in America for the past four years, excluding corporate fleet sales, and it's on track to be the best seller again this year, according to Kelley Blue Book.  The Civic is sold in more than 170 countries but the US, alone, accounts for nearly half of its sales, said Gary Robinson, assistant vice president for product planning at American Honda Motor Company, the Japanese automaker's US arm. ""It's been one of the best-selling cars in America the entire time it's been out,"" he said. The Civic was first sold in the US in 1973, shortly after the model was introduced in Japan. It met with immediate success thanks, in part, to an OPEC oil embargo that caused gasoline prices to surge, spurring demand for fuel-efficient cars. The term ""best-selling car,"" of course, does not include crossover SUVs, which sell in even higher numbers these days. That's why Honda's best-selling model overall in the US is the compact sport utility vehicle, the CR-V, not the Civic.  But the Civic is important for Honda because it attracts young, value-focused buyers (prices for the current Civic start at just over $20,000.) Those Civic buyers, as they get older and their incomes increase, often become loyal Honda customers, Robinson said. That's why Honda revealed the new Civic on Twitch, a streaming and social media platform for video game players, Tuesday evening. Two-thirds of Twitch users are under the age of 35, according to Honda. Honda claims to be the only automaker with a dedicated gaming channel on the network. The design of the Civic looks more restrained and upscale than the current model. It's intended to make the car appear larger than it is. New taillights, with a strong horizontal line, add an impression of width. Changes were also made to improve visibility for the driver. The windshield, and the entire passenger cabin, have been moved further back to give the car a longer hood while moving the windshield closer to the driver for better visibility to the sides. Inside, the new Civic will have its first fully-digital gauge cluster as standard equipment. A honeycomb mesh accent along the dashboard hides air vents to give the interior a simpler appearance. Honda didn't provide any details about the car's engine or transmission except that, executives said, manual transmissions will be available in all versions, at least as an option. Executives also said the new Civic will be more powerful and more fuel-efficient than the current model. The company has offered hybrid versions in years past as well, though for the previous generation Honda moved the hybrid model that used the basic Civic design to its own nameplate, Insight. The new Civic will go on sale in the late spring starting with the sedan version. Later, the hatchback and the performance-oriented Civic Si and Civic Type R models will go on sale. "
2,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/investing/arrival-startup-spac/index.html,Electric bus startup Arrival rides latest craze to Wall Street,"Arrival said in a statement on Wednesday that it has agreed to merge with ""blank-check"" company CIIG, in the United States, a deal that values the startup at $5.4 billion and gives it a stock market listing.  The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Arrival said it would raise around $660 million from the deal, and be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""ARVL."" Arrival had been ranked among the top 10 most valuable UK startups as a private company. CIIG is a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which means it has limited operating assets and raised capital through an IPO for the purpose of buying an existing business. CIIG was founded by Peter Cuneo, a former CEO of Remington Products who is also credited with turning around media giant Marvel. Arrival is the latest electric automaker to take advantage of seemingly limitless investor appetite for SPACs. Rival startups Nikola Corp and Fisker both announced earlier this year they would go public via the same route.  A staggering $54 billion has been raised by US-listed SPACs this year, according to Refinitiv. That is four times more than the next closest annual total. And 2020 isn't over yet. During the third quarter, SPACs accounted for nearly half of all money raised by US IPOs, according to Dealogic. Arrival has sought to stand out in the crowded field of electric vehicles by focusing its efforts on vans and buses. The company has also developed assembly ""microfactories"" that it says can be deployed anywhere in the world within six months. Major carmakers Hyundai (HYMTF) and Kia Motors have already invested in Arrival, as have funds managed by investment giant BlackRock. UPS (UPS), another early investor, announced earlier this year that it would purchase at least 10,000 electric vans from the startup.  ""Arrival's bold, game-changing approach to the production of electric vehicles made the company the clear winner in our search for a partner,"" Cuneo said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We look excitedly to the future and to our partnership with Arrival's talented leadership team."" The world's top automakers have in recent years committed huge sums to the development of electric vehicles, a transformation needed to meet tough new emissions standards in China and Europe. The UK government on Wednesday moved up its ban on gasoline and diesel cars by five years to 2030. Volkswagen (VLKAF) plans to roll out more than 60 new electrified models over the next decade, for example. Toyota (TM) has outlined a goal to have electric vehicles account for roughly half its sales by 2025. — Michelle Toh, Matt Egan and Hanna Ziady contributed reporting."
3,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/business/diesel-petrol-ban-uk/index.html,UK to ban sales of new diesel and gasoline cars in 2030,"The UK government said in a statement Wednesday that it would end the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars and vans five years earlier than previously planned, putting it on course to be the first G7 country to decarbonize road transport. Sales of new hybrid vehicles will be allowed to continue until 2035.  The ban is part of a broader ""green industrial revolution"" blueprint announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson that includes £12 billion ($16 billion) in government investment. The government hopes the private sector will chip in over three times that amount.  ""Although this year has taken a very different path to the one we expected, the United Kingdom is looking to the future and seizing the opportunity to build back greener,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""The recovery of our planet and of our economies can and must go hand-in-hand."" To accelerate sales of cleaner vehicles, the government will spend £1.3 billion ($1.7 billion) on electric vehicle charging points, and nearly £500 million ($664 million) to develop and produce batteries for electric cars. Some £582 million ($773 million) in subsidies will make zero and ultra-low emission vehicles cheaper for people to buy. But the more aggressive deadline could pose problems for the British auto industry, which has been hobbled by years of uncertainty over the country's exit from the European Union and the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Production has slumped dramatically, and the industry has warned that failing to strike a new trade deal with the European Union before the end of December deadline would cost it £47 billion ($62.5 billion) over the next five years. ""We share government's ambition for leadership in decarbonizing road transport and are committed to the journey,"" Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said in a statement. ""Manufacturers have invested billions to deliver vehicles that are already helping thousands of drivers switch to zero, but this new deadline ... sets an immense challenge."" The new UK deadline is among the most aggressive in the world. Norway, which has a much smaller economy than Britain and a significant head start in the race to put more electric cars on the road, has said that all new passenger cars and vans sold should be zero-emission vehicles by 2025. Hawes said that much more work needs to be done in the United Kingdom. ""Success will depend on reassuring consumers that they can afford these new technologies, that they will deliver their mobility needs and, critically, that they can recharge as easily as they refuel. For that, we look to others to step up and match our commitment,"" he said. ""We will now work with government on the detail of this plan, which must be delivered at pace to achieve a rapid transition."" Other components of the UK climate plan announced on Wednesday include quadrupling the production of offshore wind by 2030, boosting hydrogen and nuclear power, improving public transportation and making homes and public buildings more energy efficient. The government also wants to expand efforts to plant trees, and develop technology that allows carbon emissions to be captured before they harm the environment. ""This is a shared global challenge — every country in the world needs to take action to secure the future of the planet for our children, grandchildren and generations to come,"" Johnson said."

Shares of Reliance Industries dropped in Mumbai after the company posted disappointing earnings late Friday, mainly due to a tough quarter for its giant oil refinery business. Earnings for that unit ""were much weaker than our estimate,"" analysts at Nomura wrote in a research note following the report. Pretax profit fell 30% over the three months through September compared to a year ago, although other parts of Reliance helped offset the slump in oil, including its retail and technology units, the analysts noted. Reliance stock was little changed Tuesday. Reliance is one of India's most valuable and recognizable companies. The powerhouse conglomerate — which spans oil, petrochemicals, telecommunications and retail — has been undergoing a shift in focus recently as Ambani, its chairman and CEO, tries to transform it into a global tech giant.  Ambani turned heads earlier this year after he raised more than $20 billion in just four months for the tech arm of his business, Jio Platforms. Half of that was secured in just one month, underscoring the executive's aggressive ambitions. Analysts have said that the CEO is under pressure to prove out the technology his firm has developed and offset the massive declines he's experiencing in oil and other sectors. The coronavirus pandemic has ravaged global oil demand this year, due to steep drops in travel, transport, industrial and commercial activity. Ambani's ambitions don't end with tech. Last month, the billionaire continued his fundraising spree, this time focusing his efforts on the company's shopping empire, Reliance Retail. And in recent weeks, Reliance has clashed with US juggernaut Amazon (AMZN) over a deal it struck with a local retail chain, underscoring the fierce battle the company is waging to improve its standing in the industry. Ambani, who is still estimated to be worth $71 billion, became one of the world's 10 wealthiest people this year as he built up his group's massive war chest. Reliance Industries shares are up 25% for the year so far, helping boost Ambani's net worth by more than a fifth, or $12.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires. — Sherisse Pham contributed to this report."
5,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/31/success/ssc-tuatara-speed-record/index.html,Car company that claimed speed record will do it over,"The vehicle, which was tested on a closed-off seven-mile stretch of a Nevada highway on October 10, reached 331.15 miles per hour -- the highest speed ever achieved on a public road, according to the company. The claimed official top speed of a combined average of 316.11 mph was the result of two runs in opposite directions, to account for wind and road variations. A number of automotive journalists and bloggers analyzed video that purported to show the 331 mph run and noticed discrepancies in the speeds shown in the video and the times in which the car crossed known landmarks along the highway. The company later admitted that there had been problems with synchronization and timing in the video which had been produced by an outside production company. SSC North America is not backing down from claims that its car, the SSC Tuatara, actually hit the speeds claimed. But it is planning to repeat the attempt so there are no questions whatsoever surrounding the record, said founder Jerod Shelby.  ""No matter what we do in the coming days to salvage this particular record there's always going to be a stain on it,"" he said in a video statement released late Friday.  Shelby is not related to Carroll Shelby, the famed founder of Shelby American, the company that makes Shelby Cobra sports cars and Shelby Mustangs. The SSC Tuatara is powered by a 1,750-horsepower turbocharged V-8 engine. It's named after a lizard from New Zealand, which takes its name from a Māori word for ""peaks on the back."" The company plans to produce a total of 100 Tuataras, with a starting price of $1.9 million each. SSC previously had a world speed record with another car, the Ultimate Aero, which got to 256.14 mph in 2007, according to the company. In order to respond to additional questions raised about timing equipment during that first run -- speeds were recorded using GPS -- equipment made by multiple companies will be used and representatives of those firms will be on site to monitor the installation and use of the equipment, Shelby said in his video statement. During the first attempt, only one company's equipment was used and that firm reportedly later said its representatives were not on site to personally oversee its installation and use. SSC has not said when the next record attempt might take place. Michelle Toh contributed to this report."
6,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/business/larry-fink-trump-biden-election/index.html,Wall Street's $8 trillion man: Markets are 'tired' of Trump chaos,"At least, that's the conclusion from one of the most powerful figures on Wall Street: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. ""I do believe strongly that the market is in desire of more stability, of less volatility,"" Fink said during a pre-taped conversation airing Wednesday evening at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.  ""They're looking for a voice that moderates, not a voice that incites,"" the BlackRock chief said, according to a transcript viewed first by CNN Business. ""I truly believe President-elect Biden can be that voice of reason.""  The pro-business pillars of the Trump agenda, namely tax cuts and deregulation, helped boost markets. But Fink's comments underscore some of the downsides of the Trump era: unpredictable decision-making, firings of top officials via tweet and a deepening of political divisions.  ""We're all tired. We're tired about all the volume we hear out of Washington,"" Fink said during the conversation with David Rubenstein, the billionaire co-founder and executive chairman of the Carlyle Group. 'A little more global harmony' The BlackRock (BLK) CEO added that he believes investors are ""encouraged by having a leader now that is more inclusive, a leader that could probably bring a little more global harmony."" Fink referenced Biden's November 8 victory speech, when the president-elect pledged not to govern the blue states or red states, only the United States.  ""For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight,"" Biden said. ""I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance."" After stumbling the week before the election, the S&P 500 (SPX) notched its best election week performance since 1932. The rally was driven by relief over the relative calm of the election itself, the emergence of a winner and hopes that Republicans' stronger-than-expected Senate performance will keep government divided in 2021. ""Gridlock"" in Washington means Biden likely won't be able to hike taxes or enact sweeping climate policies. ""The market likes a divided government,"" Fink said. ""They want to make sure there's proper checks and balances."" Fink has mainly contributed money to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton during her unsuccessful 2016 bid for the presidency. At the time, Fink was mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary in a Clinton administration. But he has also backed Republicans, such as former House Speaker Paul Ryan.  Inequality is getting worse BlackRock the world's largest asset manager, overseeing $7.8 trillion. And its iShares family of ETFs is incredibly popular, hauling in $41 billion of assets during the third quarter alone.  In fact, BlackRock is so powerful that the federal government asked for its help during each of the last two recessions. In March, the Federal Reserve made history by setting up a special purpose vehicle to buy junk bonds and other corporate debt for the first time ever. The Fed tapped BlackRock to manage the program, which helped restore confidence in financial markets.  Fink praised the Federal Reserve's response to the crisis as ""nothing but amazing.""  However, he warned the pandemic is worsening the divide between rich and poor. ""The poor do not own financial assets, so the divide because of the strength of the equity markets and the job losses that we've witnessed has really created even more of an income inequality,"" Fink said. ""If we are going to try to really rebuild our economy, we need a very targeted fiscal stimulus for those who are still unemployed."" If Biden asked for his advice, Fink said, he would urge the incoming administration to focus on creating jobs through a long-overdue infrastructure package to fix crumbling roads and bridges. ""More than any other country, we need a strong infrastructure bill right now,"" he said. ""We have $2 trillion of deferred maintenance."" Rubenstein asked the BlackRock boss if he'd consider leaving his job to become Fed chief, Treasury Secretary or another major policy job. Fink demurred, but he didn't rule it out. ""I've committed to my employees and to my board and to my family already,"" Fink said, ""I'm staying in New York for the time being."""
7,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/09/energy/iea-clean-energy-transition-summit-spc-intl/index.html,"'Coal has no place in Covid-19 recovery plans,' says UN chief","""Coal has no place in Covid-19 recovery plans,"" he said on Thursday, via video link during an online summit hosted by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The summit included 40 government ministers from countries around the world, representing 80% of global energy use and emissions. Its aim was to set out plans to reduce global emissions while also boosting economic recovery after Covid-19.  Guterres commended governments that have committed to green recovery plans, citing the EU, South Korea, Nigeria and Canada.  But he said many others had missed the point.  ""Some countries have used stimulus plans to prop up oil and gas companies that were already struggling financially. Others have chosen to jumpstart coal-fired power plants that don't make financial or environmental sense."" He added that new research on recovery packages in G20 nations show that twice as much recovery money has been spent on fossil fuels as on clean energy. A blueprint released by the IEA in June called on governments to invest $3 trillion in a green recovery.  It said failure to act now would risk a repeat of the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, when governments did not prioritize stimulus spending on climate, allowing CO2 emissions to bounce back with what the IEA describes as the largest increase ever recorded. Guterres said as nations channel ""trillions of dollars of taxpayers' money into recovery strategies"" they must invest in a more sustainable future. ""We can invest in fossil fuels whose markets are volatile and whose emissions lead to lethal air pollution, or we can invest in renewable energy which is reliable, clean and economically smart,"" he said. At the summit, Zhang Jinhua, director of China's National Energy Administration, said the country, which accounts for more than 50% of global coal use today, is committed to developing its clean energy sector. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, told CNN that he was ""heartened"" by China's response. He added that the summit, which drew over half a million online viewers, proved there was a widespread desire for change.  ""There is a global momentum to build a sustainable economic recovery process and momentum for clean energy transition,"" he said. "
8,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/business/boeing-737-max-grounding-cost/index.html,Boeing's 737 Max debacle could be the most expensive corporate blunder ever,"The two fatal crashes that led to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max killed 346 people.     Financially, Boeing continues to pay a hefty cost to ensure the safety of future 737 Max passengers. Direct costs Boeing has detailed about $20 billion in direct costs from the grounding: $8.6 billion in compensation to customers for having their planes grounded, $5 billion for unusual costs of production, and $6.3 billion for increased costs of the 737 Max program. The company also spent nearly $600 million for jet storage, pilot training and software updates that are not included in the company's overall cost estimate. It also established a $100 million victim compensation fund, which is also not included in Boeing's $20 billion in estimated costs.  So the costs of the grounding released by Boeing total $20.7 billion. Boeing's legal liability will almost certainly add to that cost. Published reports show that the families of the first 11 victims to settle with Boeing received at least $1.2 million each. That means the total cost is likely to top $500 million. Interest costs are adding up, too. Boeing borrowed billions of dollars at a roughly 5% interest rate to keep building 737 Max planes it can't deliver. The company built 450 Max jets during the grounding, but it hasn't delivered a single 737 Max plane in that nearly nearly two-year period.  Only about half will be delivered next year, and some deliveries will stretch as far as 2023. Boeing doesn't get most of the money from a sale until the plane is delivered to the airline, so the interest will pile up — perhaps by about $3 billion or $4 billion, said Chris Denicolo, aerospace credit analyst with Standard & Poor's.  What's clear is that the $20.7 billion in costs that Boeing has detailed is only the starting point. Bank of America puts the costs at more than $25 billion. ""It's going to be more than $20 billion. But it's hard to say how much more it's going to be,"" said Denicolo. Lost sales If financial damage from the 737 Max remains in the $20 billion range, that would not put it in the running for the most expensive mistake by a company. Volkswagen has spent €32 billion, or $38 billion, on its emissions cheating scandal. The most expensive mistake to date is the $68 billion cost to BP of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill of 2010. But BP lost little or no sales because of Deepwater Horizon, and VW suffered only a minor, short-term loss of sales from the emissions scandal. By contrast, it's clear that Boeing has suffered a huge loss in sales in the wake of the 737 Max grounding.  Because of the grounding, Boeing lost the cancellation fees that had been written into in its sales contracts for 737 Max orders. As the Covid-19 pandemic sent air travel demand plummeting, airlines have begun taking advantage of the free cancellation policy, anticipating they won't need new planes for several years. Boeing had disclosed 448 canceled orders for the Max so far this year, compared with only nine for its other models. In addition it has dropped another 782 orders from its backlog of 737 Max orders because it believes those orders are no longer certain enough to rely on. In at least some cases those uncertain plane orders are jets airline customers have said they no longer want. A 737 Max typically sells for about $55 million, or half of the stated list price, so the worst-case scenario for Boeing is that it could lose as much as $67 billion in revenue from the drop in sales.  But experts say it's more likely that Boeing will eventually sell those planes, though at a steep discount, in some cases to the same customers who are now canceling the orders. S&P's Denicolo and another industry expert agree that those steep discounts in sales price, which wouldn't have taken place if not for the grounding, are the real financial risk for Boeing.  ""Say you're an airline. If there's no longer any penalty, why not cancel all my orders, and I can buy them back much cheaper?"" said the industry expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  Boeing will not comment on the prices paid for its planes or any discounts. But the expert said it might be as much as a $20 million discount per plane, or roughly $25 billion total — more than doubling the true cost of the grounding.  Discounting many of the 3,300 other Max orders still on the books could make Boeing's total cost of its 737 Max debacle climb even higher, perhaps past the $68 billion price tag of Deepwater Horizon."
9,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/business/stock-market-election-trump-jpmorgan/index.html,JPMorgan lays out the nightmare election scenario that could send markets into a tailspin,"Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management, warned in a report Wednesday of the ""remote risk of an American horror story"" and ""constitutional mayhem."" Cembalest, who helps oversee $2.2 trillion in assets, pointed to President Donald Trump's Tuesday night firing of the top US election security official, Attorney General William Barr's decision to authorize prosecutors to probe alleged voter fraud and the fleeting drama over certifying election results in Michigan's largest county. ""Bottom line: a LOT of very unorthodox things have to happen for Trump to be reelected,"" the JPMorgan strategist wrote. ""Even so, I'm not ruling anything out."" Post-election chaos would of course rattle markets, which famously hate uncertainty. The smoother-than-feared election set off a celebration on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 notching its biggest post-election rally since 1932.  But if investors don't know who's going to be in charge of the world's largest economy, they could easily sell first and ask questions later.  ""Markets might react negatively if the US as the world's reserve currency nation is seen as sliding down a path toward electoral illegitimacy due to post-election maneuvers by political parties,"" Cembalest wrote. 'Dueling inaugurations' To be sure, legal experts say Trump's long-shot bid at overturning the election is just that, a long-shot. Put simply, Trump is losing by too many votes in too many states.  As Cembalest notes, Trump would need to ""reverse or impede results in three states"" to prevent Joe Biden from reaching the 270 electoral votes required by the Constitution. And as CNN has reported, despite Trump's baseless claims (which Twitter has repeatedly flagged), there is no evidence of the widespread fraud required to overturn those results.  ""Relax. Biden will be sworn in on January 20,"" Ohio State constitutional election law expert Edward Foley wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week, which was cited by Cembalest.  Even so, the JPMorgan strategist laid out several developments that could cast doubt on that outcome, including that one or more states submit competing slates of electors. Those competing slates would then be resolved January 6 by the new Congress through rules spelled out in the Electoral Count Act of 1887. ""The nightmare scenario for markets,"" according to Cembalest, would be if Senate Republicans declare the ECA unconstitutional, flip three states in Trump's favor to give him the required 270 electoral votes and Democrats refuse to participate.  ""All of which sets up the prospect of dueling inaugurations,"" Cembalest wrote, noting that this outcome was only ""narrowly averted"" in 1876. Another risk laid out by Cembalest is if Barr directs investigators to ""seize or impound election records"" to probe for voter fraud, slowing down the process.  Dimon: 'We have a new president' For the most part, investors have appeared to ignore Trump's war on the election results.  Markets have not flinched in response to headlines about his campaign's many lawsuits. If anything, Wall Street came to terms with the outcome of the election even before CNN and other media outlets projected Biden to be the winner.  Investors have largely focused on other matters, including the makeup of the US Senate, progress in the quest to develop a coronavirus vaccine to fight the worsening pandemic and the prospects for the economic recovery.  But some are beginning to raise concerns about a transfer of power.   ""I think we're making far too little of this,"" CNBC anchor Jim Cramer said Wednesday while expressing worries about a peaceful transition to a new administration.   Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said that although her firm's experts don't see much of a risk of ""rogue"" electors, there ""could certainly still be some black swan political event."" Perhaps heeding the warnings of Cembalest, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly urged Americans to respect the outcome of the election.  ""We need a peaceful transition. We had an election. We have a new president,"" Dimon said Wednesday during The New York Time's virtual DealBook conference. ""You should support that whether you like it or not,  because it's based on a system of faith and trust."""
10,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/business/norwegian-air-bankruptcy-protection/index.html,Norwegian Air has filed for bankruptcy ,"The budget carrier said in a statement on Wednesday that it has decided to file for examinership in Ireland, which is where its aircraft assets are held. Examinership allows companies to seek a court's protection from creditors for up to 100 days, and is the rough equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States. ""The purpose of the process is to reduce debt, rightsize the fleet and secure new capital,"" Norwegian Air said. The process is expected to take up to five months, it added. ""Seeking protection to reorganize under Irish law is a decision that we have taken to secure the future of Norwegian for the benefit of our employees, customers and investors,"" CEO Jacob Schram said. ""Our aim is to find solutions with our stakeholders that will allow us to emerge as a financially stronger and secure airline."" Norwegian Air was founded in 1993 and began a rapid expansion nearly a decade ago, seeking to apply the business model pioneered by Ryanair in Europe and Southwest in the United States to transatlantic flights. But the aggressive strategy left it with huge debts, and little room to maneuver when things went wrong. Norwegian Air said on Wednesday that it will continue to operate its route network, which has been severely limited as a result of the coronavirus, and its shares will trade as normal on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than 98% of its value this year. The carrier warned last week that it would need additional cash to continue operating through the first quarter of next year and beyond. It received a state-backed loan of 3 billion Norwegian Krone ($288.7 million) in May, but the country's government has ruled out providing more financial assistance — a decision Schram described as ""a slap in the face."" The airline carried just 1 million passengers in the third quarter, compared to 10.5 million during the same period last year.

This job-matching site wants to change that,"After months of being ignored by recruiters in her home country of South Africa, the economics graduate began using a recruitment website called Giraffe. Compared to the experience of being ""ghosted"" by other recruiters, Zondani says getting guidance every step of the way was like ""a breath of fresh air,"" and she eventually landed a job with an insurance company. Zondani knows she is one of the lucky ones in the current economic climate. South Africa was already in recession and struggling with record-high unemployment before the pandemic. In 2019, it had the world's highest youth unemployment rate, at 56%, and Covid-19 has led to even more job losses. But Giraffe believes it can help those hit the hardest: unskilled and less educated workers. Founded in 2015 by Anish Shivdasani and Shafin Anwarsha, Giraffe has automated the recruitment process, from sourcing candidates to screening them.  Where jobseekers would usually apply for positions on paper or in person, they can now upload their résumé to the online platform, and an algorithm will match them with relevant jobs.   Giraffe was built for mobile devices, which is how most South Africans primarily access the internet, explains Shivdasani. Smartphone penetration in the country has doubled from 2016 to 91% in 2019. Of those with internet access, around 60% use a mobile device. While other job portals and recruitment agencies often target high-skilled jobseekers, Shivdasani says Giraffe's focus is primarily on entry to mid-level jobs. ""We really target the mass segment of the market,"" Shivdasani tells CNN Business. ""We define it as salaries between 3,000 and 25,000 rand ($177 to $1,470) a month."" This income range represents about two-thirds of the total South African workforce, he adds. Shivdasani and Anwarsha met while working as strategy consultants in the telecoms industry. Shivdasani says he had always dreamed of building a platform to solve social problems in South Africa. In brainstorming where to start, he realized that unemployment was at the core of many of them. ""We felt that unemployment is probably the biggest problem in South Africa,"" he says. Giraffe is completely free for jobseekers, explains Shivdasani, and instead charges businesses to post jobs on its platform. It has worked with about 3,000 businesses and currently has one million jobseekers registered on its platform. Shivdasani estimates Giraffe reaches approximately 10 million jobseekers through partnerships with Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG). Giraffe has even developed a voice note function that lets companies listen to applicants answering questions before inviting them to interview. ""It's a combination of matching, screening and voice clips, which sets us apart from other platforms,"" Shivdasani says.  This year the company received a grant from UNICEF, which it will use to build a content portal to arm jobseekers with career advice. Giraffe declined to disclose the amount of funding it received. South Africa's structural challenges   As South Africa slowly opens up from one of the world's strictest lockdowns, unemployment is spiking and inequality is widening. A recent UNDP report estimates it will take at least five years to recover to pre-coronavirus levels of economic growth and employment. Vimal Ranchhod, an economics professor at the University of Cape Town, says skills development with the help of platforms like Giraffe is one way to assist young people. However, he cautions that it will be hard to address structural challenges in the labor market or education, many of which are tied to the country's apartheid past. ""Given the scale and nature of the problem, it requires a large-scale and long-term intervention from the government,"" he says. ""This does not mean that individual groups should not help if and when they can, because every little bit can help."""

The existing KFC store design, called the ""American Showman,"" will eventually be phased out in favor of one of the two new concepts. One design ditches the traditional dining room, an option with less square footage that would be ideal for expansion into busier areas like cities where real estate is more expensive. Chipotle and Starbucks recently debuted similar designs that are smaller than typical locations. KFC's other design emphasizes the drive-thru, which encompassed 60% of the company's sales in the third quarter. This design features two drive-thru lanes, with one dedicated to mobile order pickup. Taco Bell, which is also owned by Yum! Brands (YUM), showed off a similar idea earlier this year.  That option also includes an outdoor seating area called the ""Colonel's Porch"" and an interior dining room that's smaller than KFC's current layouts. Both concepts feature brighter branding that highlights KFC's classic red and white stripes and a brightly lit red bucket that directs customers to a newly installed ""cubby system"" for online and pickup orders.  Some restaurants will have dedicated parking spots for customers that order from KFC's app or third-party apps, as well as reserved spaces for DoorDash, Uber Eats and Postmates delivery drivers. KFC said the new designs will roll out in three US locations next year, including West Palm Beach, Indianapolis and central Kentucky.  The drive-thru has become even more important for quick serve restaurants during the pandemic, with multiple chains, including McDonald's and Chipotle, revealing in recent earnings calls that restaurants with them have seen sales increase faster. McDonald's, Burger King and Popeye's all have announced restaurant redesigns that enhance their drive-thrus. "

The National Payments Corporation of India, an organization affiliated with the Reserve Bank of India, confirmed in a statement Thursday that it had given approval for WhatsApp to roll out the service to more people, starting with a user base of up to 20 million accounts.  The company had been testing the tool in India since 2018 with up to 1 million users. The country is WhatsApp's biggest market, with 400 million users.  ""I am excited today that WhatsApp has been approved to launch payments across India,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video statement. ""Now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp as easily as sending a message."" The feature is already available on the latest version of the app in 10 Indian languages. Facebook noted that anyone who wants to use the service needs to have a bank account and debit card with a lender that allows users to make transactions across different apps in India. WhatsApp has made no secret of its ambitions to start providing more services to users in India.  It first announced plans to move into online payments more than three years ago and in 2018, appointed the co-founder of a digital payments firm, Abhijit Bose, as its first India chief, signaling a desire to ramp up its plans in the space. Facebook's latest move also comes as the company is spending big money in India. In April, it pumped $5.7 billion into Jio Platforms, the tech firm run by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Jio Payments Bank, which operates under Ambani's Reliance Industries umbrella, is one of the partners on WhatsApp's new payments venture. — Rishi Iyengar contributed to this report."
14,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/07/tech/india-smartphone-apple-intl-hnk/index.html,India offers Samsung and iPhone suppliers new incentives to boost local production,"The program includes 16 companies involved in making smartphones and components, including Samsung (SSNLF), Austria's AT&S and several Indian firms. Major Apple (AAPL) suppliers Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron are participating as well — notable inclusions, given how much Apple has been pushing to grab a larger slice of one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets. The companies have to increase their production of smartphones in the country to benefit, according to a Tuesday statement from India's Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology. They will get incentives worth between 4% and 6% of the sales of certain products made in India over a period of 5 years. The incentive program is expected to bring 110 billion rupees ($1.5 billion) worth of investment to the country's electronics manufacturing industry, according to the government statement.  The government's decision to incentivize smartphone makers isn't a huge surprise. The industry has been booming in India, and is now worth about $230 billion, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association.  China's Xiaomi tripled the number of smartphone plants it has in India on its way to top spot in the market, while global leader Samsung opened what it claims is the ""world's largest mobile factory"" near New Delhi in 2018. Apple began manufacturing some iPhones in Bangalore in 2017 and recently started domestic production of the iPhone 11. While the Indian government named the program's participants, it did not disclose how much each company is expected to invest. But Reuters reported, citing sources, that Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron plan to invest nearly $900 million in the next five years to benefit from the incentives.  Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Foxconn chairman Liu Young-Way reportedly said at a shareholders meeting in June that the company was planning further investment in India. The Taiwanese firm already has a plant in India, where it manufactures smartphones for Apple and other clients.  Apple and Samsung ""together account for nearly 60% of global sales revenue of mobile phones,"" the Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology said, adding that the program was expected to ""increase their manufacturing base manifold in the country."" Apple's ambitions For Apple, the nod from regulators for its suppliers could provide a tailwind for the company's India ambitions. Apple holds less than 2% of India's smartphone market, though has been trying to grow that amount and increase its presence in the country. The iPhone maker launched its online store in the country last month, and it also wants to open its first physical store there next year. Part of the problem is that many of the company's products are seen as prohibitively expensive for most Indians. Apple sets prices in different countries based in part on taxes and the local currency's strength against the dollar. The 64GB variant of the iPhone XR costs about $120 more in India than it does in the United States. Expanding local smartphone production would allow Apple to avoid India's heavy import taxes on iPhones, potentially making them cheaper for Indian customers. The government's new incentives could mean that ""more of the local India iPhones sales is catered by the locally produced iPhones, which would bring down the cost,"" said IDC senior research manager Kiranjeet Kaur. She noted that so far, iPhones made in India are older generation models, with new flagship phones still coming from China.  Apple is also expected to release its latest iPhone later this month, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said there is ""a spike in demand out of India.""   The ""region could translate into some surprising iPhone units upside as Apple heads into this key launch period,"" Ives wrote in a note on Wednesday.  — Rishi Iyengar contributed to this report."
15,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/success/rivian-electric-pickup-suv-order/index.html,"First Rivian electric pickup trucks will sell for $75,000","The Michigan-based startup said prices will start at $75,000 for the Launch Edition of its R1T pickup and $77,500 for the Launch Edition of its R1S SUV.  Both Launch Edition vehicles will offer more than 300 miles of driving range on a full charge, although a longer range version of the R1T pickup offering more than 400 miles of range will be available in January 2022. A longer range version of the R1S SUV will become available later, as will lower priced shorter range versions of both vehicles. These will have enough power to go 250 miles between charges, the company said. Rivian's prices are similar to high-performance all-wheel-drive versions of Tesla's Cybertruck, with a promised range of over 500 miles. That truck is due to be delivered to customers late next year. Rivian's price is slightly less than Tesla's Model X SUV, which has a range of 371 miles. And Rivian's prices are much less than the initial $113,000 General Motors will be asking for the GMC Hummer EV.  The first Rivian R1T pickups will be delivered to customers in the United States in June 2021, with the first R1S SUVs being delivered in August. Versions other than Launch Edition models will be available in January, 2022. Customers who have already placed deposits will be able to start pre-ordering their truck or SUV on Rivian's website on Monday. Others will be able to start ordering on November 23. The site will allow buyers to choose from at least 10 different colors for their vehicles, along with different wheel and tire packages. Customers will also be able to choose between two equipment packages: Adventure or Explore. Both will feature an all-glass roof, WiFi with 4G capability and a flashlight in the driver's side door. The Adventure package will include underbody reinforcements for protection during off-road driving and a power-operated cover for the pickup's cargo bed. Models with the less expensive Explore package will be similarly priced to the Launch Edition models, and will have matte black finishes inside the cabin and heated vegan ""leather"" seats. The Explore-equipped pickups will come with a manually-operated bed cover that can be stored inside the cargo tunnel that runs the width of the truck below the bed. Prices for R1T pickups with the Explore package will start at $67,500 and, for R1S SUVs, $70,000. These prices do not include the $7,500 tax incentive for electric vehicles. All the trucks will have Rivian's Driver+ hands-free driving technology, similar to systems offered by General Motors and Ford. Like those systems, Rivian's will work only on some selected highways in the United States. Unlike Tesla's Autopilot, Rivian's Driver+ technology is designed for long-term continuous operation without the driver having to touch the steering wheel. Rivian has financial backing from a number of companies, including Amazon (AMZN), for which it is building 100,000 electric delivery vans, and Ford (F)."
16,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/business/biden-wall-street-transition-elizabeth-warren/index.html,Joe Biden fires an early warning shot at Wall Street,"President-elect Joe Biden's agency review teams include several people who share Warren's reputation for being tough on the financial industry.  It's more evidence of the influence of Warren, a fierce opponent of big banks and the excesses of Wall Street -- as well as an early signal that Wall Street will be under much greater scrutiny, especially compared to four years of President Donald Trump's efforts to dismantle regulation and unshackle big banks. ""The big-bank CEOs who read that list are probably somewhat concerned,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading. ""Progressives absolutely won the day on this."" Biden tapped about 500 people to work with government agencies, from the CIA to the United States Postal Service, and help shape the future of government policy and appointments.  'He made a lot of enemies' Perhaps top on Wall Street's worry list is Gary Gensler, who will lead the team working with financial regulatory agencies including the Federal Reserve, SEC and FDIC. Gensler led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from May 2009 to January 2014. Among the Obama-era regulators, Gensler was the most aggressive in implementing the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that Wall Street opposed. ""Gary Gensler undoubtedly brings back some bad memories,"" said Boltansky. Although Gensler is a former Goldman Sachs banker, he is now viewed as a tough-on-Wall-Street ally of Warren. ""He made a lot of enemies in DC and the industry,"" said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. ""The fact he's leading this is a signal to the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party that they have a voice on financial regulatory picks."" Biden taps vocal critic of big banks, private equity The financial regulatory team also includes Dennis Kelleher, the CEO of Better Markets, a nonprofit founded after the 2008 financial crisis focused on holding Wall Street accountable.  Kelleher, who declined to comment, is not exactly from the Robert Rubin wing of the Democratic party. (Rubin, a former Goldman Sachs chairman, served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton.) Last month, Kelleher condemned Goldman Sachs as a ""recidivist lawbreaker"" that has ""preyed upon and ripped off countless Main Street Americans and many others."" In a June interview with CNN Business, Kelleher slammed what he called the ""predatory private equity business model"" of firing workers and unloading pension obligations after leveraged buyouts. ""Once a private equity firm extracts the maximum amount of value, it then tries to flip it into the public markets so it can cash out on the near-carcass of a corporation,"" Kelleher said.  That reads like a jab from one of Warren's infamous bank CEO takedowns. Meanwhile, Biden has a separate team overseeing the transition of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency that is a Warren brainchild of Warren. That team is being led by Leandra English, the CFPB's former deputy director. In 2017, English unsuccessfully tried to block Trump from installing as the agency's acting director Mick Mulvaney -- who once pushed to abolish the CFPB. While testifying as acting director, Mulvaney defended his tenure by saying, ""I have not burned the place down."" ""Leandra English has deep experience, not just on the issues, but on how the mechanics of the CFPB works,"" said Compass Point's Boltansky.  He noted that the Trump transition met some ""bumps in the road"" because the president tapped some people who didn't have much experience in government.    No major overhaul is coming Of course, it's important to note that Biden has only named a transition team, not a full Cabinet. There is no guarantee his picks to lead major agencies will ultimately please Warren and the progressive wing of the party. And even if Biden wanted to pick regulators who would be very tough on Wall Street, Republicans in the US Senate may have the votes to block those appointments. (Unless Democrats sweep the runoff races in Georgia, Republicans will retain control of the Senate.) ""Progressives are absolutely first on that invisible scoreboard between progressives and centrists,"" Boltansky said.  But Boltansky noted that ""we're at a very different point in the evolution of financial regulation"" than in 2009, when the Obama administration was taking over. Back then, during the Great Recession, it was clear that a major Wall Street overhaul was not just inevitable, but necessary. And it took years to implement the Dodd-Frank law of 2010. Today, Wall Street is not viewed as the top priority, with the Biden administration likely to focus instead on the pandemic, inequality and the climate crisis. And the fact that banks have withstood the turmoil of the health crisis (so far at least) suggests Dodd-Frank worked to strengthen the system.  Is too-big-to-jail over? But that doesn't mean Biden-appointed regulators won't put a stop to practices they view as unfair. Analysts are warning the Biden administration could crack down on overdraft fees, the banking industry's $11 billion gravy train that critics say punish society's most vulnerable.  And Biden's regulators could take a much tougher stance on bad behavior like the laundry list of scandals at Wells Fargo (WFC).  ""If you're a bank that has a scandal, then you need to be worried,"" said Mills, the Raymond James analyst.  It's no coincidence that Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup all reached major settlements this fall with the Trump administration ahead of the change in power. Even former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf agreed to a personal $2.5 million penalty over his role in the fake-accounts scandal. Still, Biden will be under pressure from progressives to take a tough stance on enforcement. Critics say the Obama administration adopted a too-big-to-jail mindset by failing to go after big banks and their top executives.  Yet like other Democrats, Biden will have to balance that urge to root out Wall Street wrongdoing with the need to keep capital flowing.  ""They need the economy to work to get reelected,"" said Mills. ""And you can't have the economy work if the banking sector isn't."""
17,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/success/vaccine-real-estate-new-york-city/index.html,How a vaccine could upend real estate markets -- again,"Nationally, home prices have never been higher, driven up as surging demand due to record low mortgage rates comes up against historically low inventory of homes for sale.  But the most expensive urban areas have been experiencing the opposite problem. Cities like New York and San Francisco have seen higher vacancy rates and lower rents and sale prices as many people, untethered from office jobs, retreated to the suburbs and less densely populated areas.  But with potential vaccines on the horizon, real estate in big cities could see a turnaround.  ""It's not going to be a light switch,"" said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraiser and consultant in New York City. ""But the news is starting to get people to be hopeful and think about returning to the city. Because right now, without a vaccine, it is status quo."" While widespread vaccination is still a ways off, the news alone is a good sign that real estate in cities will continue to recover as the prospect of vaccines becomes more realistic, said Richard Smith, chairman and executive director of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, a nonprofit that studies recurring patterns in economics, social sciences and nature.  ""Sometimes it is when the news gets less bad that you get your biggest gains,"" he said. Real estate investment trusts (REITs), investments backed by real estate, that had cratered when the pandemic broke out, have already recovered some of their losses and moved higher on the vaccine news.  Here's what the vaccine could mean for renters and home buyers. Will people return to cities? The more a vaccine brings life closer to ""normal,"" the more city real estate markets will change, said Miller.  ""Once the vaccine is out and the population begins seeing schools reliably open and the big companies bringing people back in, that's where it snowballs,"" he said. ""Then people can make plans around it."" In Manhattan, the rental market will come back first, he said, because that activity has fallen the most and there is a lower bar to entry. But with rental inventory currently triple what it was a year ago, don't expect rents to go up soon.  The Manhattan rental market remains historically weak. Last month saw a record-high number of apartments available to rent and a record-high share of rental apartments leased with concessions like one or two months free rent, according to brokerage firm Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.  The vacancy rate in Manhattan is at a new all-time high of 6.14%. That's caused record price declines in rents. The median rent for a one bedroom in Manhattan in October, for example, was $3,064 a month, down 4.1% from September and down 14.8% from a year ago.   ""There has been a precipitous drop in the cost of a rental and the expectation is that there is still more of that ahead, until the inventory is eaten up,"" said Miller. ""There is still a lot of runway ahead. We'll be well into 2021 and a vaccine until we get into an uptick in pricing.""  For those looking to buy, purchasing a home in New York will be more attractive when a vaccine makes all the things a city has to offer possible again, Miller said, including easy access to dining, theater, concerts and events.  ""The first thing that has to happen in terms of really accelerating the re-adoption of city life in the post-pandemic world, is going to be when companies, especially the Fortune 500 companies as leaders, start to bring people back to work,"" he said. Buyers won't leave the suburbs behind The uncertainty of this past year has left a mark on buyers, particularly those with higher incomes who can afford a second home near the city as a refuge that requires no planes or planning, said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Douglas Elliman Real Estate. ""The virus made the home very important,"" said Herman. ""Working from home will be here to stay, in some way. It won't be only working from home, but some combination of at home and the office.""  That has created wish lists for new homes that include outdoor space and offices and it has expanded locations for buyers, lengthening the commuting tether between home and office, she said.  Strong demand in the suburbs and resort communities near cities will continue, she said. Even though many suburban areas around New York passed their pandemic peak in the summer, in many areas sales are still above levels seen a year ago.  ""People have gotten used to working from home and are comfortable living farther from the city,"" she said. ""That won't change with a vaccine. Second homes will continue to be a booming market nationally.""  Will mortgage rates stay low? Mortgage interest rates hit a 12th all-time low heading into November, and some economists say even lower rates may be ahead. Others, however, say the vaccine news could reverse the downward trend.  ""While rates are always unpredictable, sustained record lows are looking less likely in light of recent events,"" said Brendan Phillips, a capital markets analyst at Better.com, an online lender. ""Rates jumped when pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced its Covid-19 vaccine had shown 90% efficacy in trials."" Goldman Sachs analysts pointed to the encouraging progress of vaccine research as a reason to think the economy may sustain a ""V-shaped"" recovery, bouncing back quickly to pre-pandemic levels. Other economists say that the ability of Congress to finally pass a stimulus package will also affect the speed of the country's recovery from the current recession.  ""Good news for the economy, though, usually means higher rates,"" said Phillips."

The film will be released simultaneously in theaters and on the streaming service in the United States on December 25. It will debut in international markets on December 16. The film, which stars Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, will be available for a month on HBO Max in the United States at no additional cost to subscribers. Once it leaves the service, it will continue to play in theaters. After that, the film will become available via video on demand, digital rental and for purchase. WarnerMedia is the parent company of Warner Bros., as well as CNN. ""As we navigate these unprecedented times, we've had to be innovative in keeping our businesses moving forward while continuing to super-serve our fans,"" Ann Sarnoff, CEO of WarnerMedia studios and networks group, said in a statement. ""We realize that a lot of consumers can't go back to the movies due to the pandemic, so we also want to give them the option to see Wonder Woman 1984 via our HBO Max platform."" The choice to put ""Wonder Woman 1984"" on HBO Max as well as theaters cannot be understated. ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was widely believed to be one of the biggest films of the year before the pandemic broke out, and had a good shot at making $1 billion globally. Jason Kilar, the CEO of WarnerMedia, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday that there were several factors in the company's decision: the pandemic; being supportive partners to the cast and crew of the film; and ""our belief in the theatrical experience and, to that end, the importance of exhibitors.""  Kilar also mentioned fans of the film, which is ""where important decisions like this should always start and should always end."" Kilar noted that choosing between viewing the film in theaters versus on streaming is ""your decision to make."" But it's hard to see how big of an audience the film's theatrical release will ultimately bring in with coronavirus cases still surging across the country. Theaters have been hit incredibly hard this year because of coronavirus, closing for months. When theaters did reopen with Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet,"" another film from Warner Bros., audiences were hard to come by. As for HBO Max, ""Wonder Woman 1984"" has the potential to bring in more subscribers. The service announced this week that it came to agreement with Amazon (AMZN) to include the service on its Amazon Fire TV devices."
19,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/business/boeing-737-max-approval/index.html,Boeing's 737 Max gets approval to fly passengers again,"The plane, the best-selling jet in Boeing's (BA) fleet, was grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. It was discovered that a safety feature meant to stop the plane from climbing too fast and stalling had improperly forced the nose of the plane down, causing the crashes. The process of approving the plane to carry passengers has stretched on far longer than originally expected and cost Boeing more than $20 billion, according to the company. Lost orders for the jet during that time could make it among the most expensive mistakes ever made by a company. Although approval was expected this week, Boeing (BA) shares rose in morning trading, but then closed lower, along with broader markets, on concerns a rise in Covid-19 cases. The first step The FAA action is only the first step in allowing 59 airlines -- spread across 32 countries -- to once again fly the 387 grounded planes as part of their schedules. The FAA orders cover only US domestic flights for the 737 Max jets operated by American, United and Southwest Airlines, 72 in total. Flights to or within other countries will need the approval of those nations' aviation authorities. And as for the US, the FAA noted in statement that before any of the planes can be flown with passengers again, the necessary changes to the 737 Max identified in the approval process must be installed and the FAA must inspect the individual planes. The pilots must also complete additional training.  That process is expected to take between a few weeks and a few months, depending on the airline. So far only American Airlines (AAL) has added the plane to its schedule for a handful of flights between Miami and New York in late December and early January.  Other airlines are holding off. Southwest (LUV), which has 34 of the jets -- more than any other airline -- isn't expected to fly passengers on the 737 Max until spring 2021. United (UAL) said it expects to start flying the planes in the first three months of 2021. Weakness in demand What's not yet clear is whether passengers will try to avoid flying  on a 737 Max once those flights resume. US airlines are no longer charging change fees to passengers who shift their travel plans, so fliers who want to book away from a 737 Max flight can do so without penalty.  ""If a customer doesn't want to fly on the 737 Max, they won't have to,"" said a letter from American Airline executives to the carrier's employees on Wednesday. But Travel Fairness Now, a consumer group, said Thursday it believes passengers should be able to get refunds on their tickets instead of a credit if they don't want to fly on a 737 Max jet, and then book on another flight to the same destination without paying any difference in fares. ""The circumstances surrounding the Boeing 737 Max are unprecedented in the history of commercial travel and call for extraordinary protections for understandably concerned consumers,"" said Kurt Ebenhoch, executive director of Travel Fairness Now. One thing that could slow the resumption of 737 Max flights is the extraordinary drop in air traffic demand due to the combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and the global recession it caused.  There are about 1,500 single aisle passenger jets parked by airlines around the world, according to Ascend by Cirium, a research firm that tracks plane usage -- and that number does not include grounded 737 Max jets. Rather, it represents more than 25% of the single aisle planes worldwide since the pandemic broke out.  Even if there is no need to increase the number of planes they fly, airlines still want to start using their 737 Max jets to replace older jets in their fleets, because the Max is about 15% more fuel efficient than the older planes, said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Cirium. ""Even though fuel prices are low today ... that fuel saving could still account for something like $750-$1,000 per aircraft per day,"" he said. ""In today's environment where airlines want to preserve as much cash as possible [those savings are] very welcome."" Family members of victims speak out Some of the family members of those who died in the crashes have objected to the Max's return to service. They say Boeing made mistakes in its design, the newest version of a long-serving plane, which made their version dangerous, and that the FAA erred in approving the original version and recertifying it to fly now. ""The plane is inherently unstable and it is unairworthy without its software,"" said Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samaya Rose Stumo died in the March 2019 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane. ""They haven't fixed it so far. The flying public should avoid the Max in the future. Change your flight."" Stumo and other family members held a press conference Tuesday ahead of the announcement. Stumo said the FAA should have insisted that a third sensor be added to determine if the plane is in danger of stalling. He said other changes should have been made to the way pilots are alerted if there is a problem. ""We as family members want to avoid a third crash,"" he said.  The Air Line Pilots Association, the union representing pilots at many US airlines including  United, said that while it continues to evaluate the specific crew training rules for the plane's return to service, ""ALPA believes that the engineering fixes to the flight-critical aircraft systems are sound and will be an effective component that leads to the safe return to service of the 737 Max."" Pilots unions at Southwest and American did not have an immediate comment on the FAA's action. The investigation into how to fix the plane was originally expected to be finished by the fall of 2019, but stretched on as new questions about the plane arose. FAA and Boeing praise the process ""The path that led us to this point was long and grueling,"" said FAA Administrator Steve Dickson in a video statement Wednesday. ""But we said from the start that we would take the time necessary to get this right. We were never driven by a timeline, but rather following a methodical and deliberate safety process. During this time FAA employees diligently worked on the fixes that were necessary."" As part of the review process Dickson flew the plane himself in September, and went through the training pilots will have to complete. ""Based on all the activities we have undertaken during the past 20 months, and my personal experience flying the aircraft, I can tell you now I am 100% comfortable with my family flying on it,"" he said. The FAA has worked throughout the process with aviation authorities around the world, and most are expected to issue their own orders to unground the plane as well. But there could be delays in returning the jet  to service around the world. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency, which oversees flights in Europe, said Wednesday it expects to take action in late December or early 2021.  And regulator Transport Canada said it expects to conclude its review ""very soon,"" although it added, ""there will be differences between what the FAA has approved today, and what Canada will require for its operators."" Boeing also said it is confident that the plane will be safe to fly once all the required steps are taken. ""We will never forget the lives lost in the two tragic accidents that led to the decision to suspend operations,"" said David Calhoun, chief executive officer of The Boeing Company. ""These events and the lessons we have learned as a result have reshaped our company and further focused our attention on our core values of safety, quality and integrity."" Problems throughout the inspection In addition to coming up with a software update to the faulty safety system, problems with the safety of the plane's wiring were discovered. There were also questions about the lack of training for pilots who were moving from the original 737 to the 737 Max, which had been a selling point for the plane. The investigation also revealed that many Boeing employees were privately expressing doubts about the planes during the original approval process.  ""Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn't,"" wrote one employee to another in an internal communication revealed during the investigation. Another employee described the plane as ""designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys."" And one wrote simply: ""piss poor design."" -- CNN's Pete Muntean, Gregory Wallace and Hanna Ziady contributed to this report Correction: Southwest Airlines pilots are represented by the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.

20,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/investing/masa-son-softbank-cash-hnk-intl/index.html,SoftBank billionaire Masa Son is stockpiling cash for a 'worst-case scenario' ,"While effective vaccines and Covid-19 treatments could soon be coming, the SoftBank CEO said he is pessimistic about second and third wave outbreaks currently playing out around the world.  ""In the next two [to] three months, any disaster could happen,"" Son said on Tuesday, speaking from Tokyo at The New York Times' Dealbook Conference held online this year.  SoftBank announced a fire sale of assets earlier this year to shore up its balance sheet as the pandemic roiled global economies and sent the value of its tech-focused Vision Fund plunging. The initial plan was to sell $41 billion worth of assets, but Son said SoftBank ended up doubling that target. ""It's the first time in our history to liquidate many of the assets as quickly as possible,"" he said.  Before mass distribution of coronavirus treatments or a vaccine become available, ""some major company could crash"" and cause a ""domino effect"" in related industries, he said, using the collapse of Lehman Brothers to illustrate his point.    The fall of just one bank shook the entire banking industry and sparked a global stock market crash, he said.  ""I still want to be prepared for the worst-case scenario, so that's why today we have now almost $80 billion cash in hand ourselves,"" Son said.    Some of that stockpile has already been used to buy back shares in SoftBank, which Son has repeatedly lamented are undervalued by investors.  The tech tycoon is also investing in established tech companies, a move he insisted is consistent with his long-term strategy of betting on the coming artificial intelligence revolution.   Companies like Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL), he said, are key players in the development of AI.  ""Unicorn, public or private, [it] doesn't matter. I just want to bet for the AI revolution,"" Son said.   Some of the bets have already gone sour. SoftBank last week reported losses of 131.7 billion yen ($1.3 billion) ""from investment in listed stocks and other instruments"" for the six months ended in September. During an earnings presentation, Son described his company's latest strategy of investing in highly liquid, blue chip companies and derivative products as ""a pilot program."" The SoftBank founder is best known for plowing huge amounts of money into private tech startups, a strategy that has over the years reaped both huge rewards and public embarrassment.  Son's most famous investment was $20 million in Alibaba (BABA) 20 years ago — a bet that was worth $60 billion when the Chinese e-commerce company went public in 2014. More recently, he has been dogged by a disastrous investment in WeWork that ended with SoftBank having to bail out the office space startup with a costly rescue package. ""We made a lot of loss in the investment in WeWork, billions of dollars. And that is my mistake,"" Son said.  ""But luckily, we have some other hit [investments]. So in total score, we are still positive,"" he said, adding that he remains hopeful that the Vision Fund will make Softbank even more money. The massive tech investment vehicle backed by Saudi Arabia booked gains of 141.4 billion yen ($1.4 billion) for the six months that ended in September after it sold shares in four companies and cashed out of six others, SoftBank said in a filing last week. The filing did not disclose which companies the fund exited."
21,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/success/volkswagen-spin-off-lamborghini-ducati-italdesign/index.html,Volkswagen says it might spin off Lamborghini and Ducati,"The potential spinoff would also include the motorcycle manufacturer Ducati and Italdesign Giugiaro, a design and engineering consulting company. VW CEO Herbert Diess indicated during a conference call with analysts Monday that the company has been working to restructure the three Italian brands with an eye toward forming them into a separate business.  This doesn't necessarily mean that will happen, though, he said. ""We are bringing it into a legal structure where we could act, but it's not yet decided,"" he said. VW could follow in the footsteps of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), which spun off Ferrari (RACE) in 2016 as a separate company with its own stock listing. Exor, a company controlled by the Agnelli family, descendents of Fiat founder Giovanni Agnelli, owns a large share of FCA and a similarly large share of Ferrari. Lamborghini's current CEO, Stefano Domenicali, announced earlier this year that he would be leaving the company to take a new job as CEO of Formula 1 racing. On Wednesday, Volkswagen announced that Stephan Winkelmann will return as CEO and President for Lamborghini, a position he last held from 2005 to 2016. He will also retain his current role as President of Bugatti, which is also owned by VW Group.  Volkswagen has also reportedly been considering selling or trading off the Bugatti brand. Neither VW Group or Bugatti would confirm those reports when asked recently Lamborghini is owned by Volkswagen Group's luxury car subsidiary Audi. Lamborghini, in turn, owns both Italdesign and Ducati. Lamborghini's global sales, while tiny by ordinary auto industry standards, have nearly doubled in recent years thanks to the introduction of the Urus crossover SUV.  The Urus shares much of its engineering with other Volkswagen Group models, including the Audi Q8 and the Bentley Bentayga. Lamborghini sold 8,300 vehicles last year, according to Volkswagen Group's annual report. Ducati is known for high-performance motorcycles, such as the 214-horsepower Panigale V4. It sells about 50,000 bikes a year worldwide.  Italdesign Giugiaro is a design and engineering consulting firm that was founded, in part, by famed Italian auto designer Giorgetto Giugiaro in 1968. Among many other cars, Giugiaro is known for his work on the DMC DeLorean and the original Volkswagen Golf. Under VW's current structure, Audi, Lamborghini and Ducati are grouped together as the Premium brand group, while Porsche, Bentley and Bugatti are the Sport and Luxury group. The Volkswagen car brand, along with SEAT, based in Spain, and Škoda, headquartered in the Czech Republic, are in VW's Volume brand group. Lamborghini, Bentley and Bugatti were all purchased separately by Volkswagen Group in 1998. "
22,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/tech/robots-india-covid-spc-intl/index.html,Robots are joining the fight against coronavirus in India,"Bangalore-based Invento Robotics has designed three robots to carry out tasks ranging from disinfecting surfaces to answering patient questions and enabling video consultations with doctors.  Of the eight the company has so far deployed, the most popular model is Mitra, which means friend in Hindi and costs around $10,000. Using facial-recognition technology, the robot can recall the names and faces of patients it has interacted with. Mitra can roam around a hospital independently, helping patients connect with family and doctors via its cameras and a video screen attached to its chest. ""Mitra can be the nurse's or doctor's assistant, take readings and vitals, remind them of medications,"" says Balaji Viswanathan, CEO of Invento Robotics. He says the human-like robot engages with patients and gains their trust. ""It may sound ironic but we are using robots to bring humanity to hospitals,"" he tells CNN Business.  Yatharth Hospital in the city of Noida, northern India, has deployed two Mitra robots — one at its entrance to screen patients for coronavirus symptoms and the other in the intensive care unit. ""Inside our ICU [Mitra] helps patients connect with their families through video stream and gives the patient's family a look inside,"" hospital director Kapil Tyagi tells CNN Business.  ""Patients get happy and positive whenever the robot visits them. They are often clicking selfies with Mitra,"" he says.  Viswanathan says Invento uses ""best in class security"" for video feeds between doctors, patients and their families. For in-depth telemedicine consultations, a booth is built around the robot to give patients privacy. Coronavirus pivot Viswanathan and his wife Mahalakshmi Radhakrushnun moved to Bangalore in 2016 from Boston, USA, where Viswanathan was completing a PhD in human robot interaction and Radhakrushnan was working in manufacturing. They wanted to combine their experience to create robots that improved patient care in hospitals and care homes, but they struggled to find customers. So they started supplying banks, including India's HDFC (HDB) and Standard Chartered (SCBFF) in Qatar, with robots who could identify visitors, print passes and take customer feedback. ""Two years ago, there was not much interest on the healthcare side,"" says Viswanathan. ""When coronavirus hit, hospitals finally understood what we were talking about.""  India has had more than 8 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 120,000 deaths. Hospitals have struggled to cope, and Invento isn't the only robotics company that is helping out.  Milagrow Robotics specializes in home cleaning robots, but has deployed five humanoid cleaning robots to Indian hospitals during the pandemic, while Kerala-based Asimov Robotics has created a robot to dispense medicine and clean up after patients. Producing robots during the pandemic has been challenging, says Viswanathan.  When India went into lockdown in March, non-essential businesses closed and his company struggled to secure materials from suppliers. ""There was a three to four-month delay. Manufacturing was a huge headache,"" he adds. But his company is starting to deliver on its mission of improving patient care. ""That is where our heart is,"" Viswanathan says."

Now the former president's new memoir, ""A Promised Land,"" is breaking records for the book's publisher, Crown, an imprint of Penguin Random House. Hundreds of thousands of people pre-ordered ""A Promised Land"" ahead of Tuesday's release date.  Those pre-order sales, plus first-day sales, totaled 887,000 units ""in all formats and editions in the U.S. and Canada,"" Penguin Random House said on Wednesday. The publisher said this result represented ""the largest first-day sales total for any book ever published"" by the company. Penguin and the rest of the publishing industry anticipated this moment: Obama's memoir, the first of two expected volumes, has been the talk of book world. For the United States and Canada, Crown printed 3.4 million copies of the hardcover edition.  Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt told Publishers Weekly earlier in the year, ""This will be a book of rare consequence. That it will sell as no other book has done since July 21, 2007"" — when ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" came out — ""is immensely cheering to booksellers."" One bookstore in Washington, D.C. even opened at midnight Tuesday morning to sell copies of ""A Promised Land."" Booksellers expect that the memoir will remain a top seller throughout the holiday season. "
24,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/tech/reliance-amazon-future-group-india-intl-hnk/index.html,Why Amazon and Reliance are clashing in India over a cash-strapped retail chain,"Amazon (AMZN), the Seattle-based e-commerce firm owned by Jeff Bezos, is fighting a $3.3 billion deal struck between Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries and the Indian retail conglomerate Future Group.  What's at stake is strategic access to a network of popular grocery stores and retail shops in India — something both Amazon and Reliance want to either have for themselves, or to prevent the other from acquiring.  ""If someone backs down, it will give the impression that one has lost and the other has won, when the fight has just started,"" said Counterpoint Research analyst Tarun Pathak.  Amazon has 31.2% market share in India's e-commerce industry, just behind Walmart-owned Flipkart's 31.9%, according to a recent report from market research firm Forrester. But Ambani has made no secret of his ambitions to upend the market with JioMart, which is part of his sprawling conglomerate.  At the heart of the current battle is Future Retail, the cash cow of Future Group. The retail unit includes brands like Big Bazaar, a well-known, popular hypermarket chain in India. In August 2019, Amazon invested in a Future Group entity that gave it a roughly 4.8% stake in Future Retail as of September 30 this year, according to stock exchange filings. The deal gave Amazon the right of first refusal to acquire more shares in Future Retail, according to one of the filings. Then Covid-19 hit. India enforced one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns, ordering shops to shutter and millions of people to stay indoors for months.  The pandemic has had a ""significant adverse impact"" on Future Retail's business operations, the company said in its most recent earnings report. In July, Future Retail's credit rating took a hit after it missed a bond payment. Fitch Ratings downgraded Future Retail's rating two notches to C, signaling that the company was ""near default.""  The following month, Reliance and Future Group announced that Reliance was buying Future Retail and several other assets. The deal allowed Future Group to ""achieve a holistic solution to the challenges that have been caused by Covid and the macro economic environment,"" Kishore Biyani, Future Group CEO, said in a statement at the time.  A legal dispute The announcement took industry watchers by surprise.   ""Everyone knew Amazon had a stake in Future Retail, and the deal didn't mention what would happen to Amazon's stake,"" said Satish Meena, analyst at research firm Forrester.  Amazon responded by filing a complaint to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).  Indian companies and foreign companies operating in India often agree to settle disputes in Singapore because ""it's a neutral jurisdiction with high integrity and international standards,"" according to Ashish Kabra, a lawyer who heads the International Dispute Resolution & Investigations Practice for Nishith Desai Associates in Singapore. The arbitration process is confidential and none of the submissions are public. Amazon argued that the 2019 deal struck between it and the Future Group entity included a non-compete clause, a person familiar with Amazon's perspective told CNN Business. The clause listed 30 restricted parties with which Future Retail and Future Group could not do business, and Reliance was on that list, the person said.  ""The key question really is what's the validity of contracts if you just ignore them,"" said the person familiar with Amazon's side. ""Are companies just going to ignore contracts and do what they please?"" A SIAC emergency arbitrator gave Amazon a small victory this week when it ordered a temporary halt on Future Group's deal with Reliance, according to the legal order seen by Reuters, which has not been made public. Future Group had argued that if the deal with Reliance falls through, its retail unit will be forced into liquidation and 29,000 people will lose their jobs, according to Reuters, which cited the Singapore order. The order is not public, but the person familiar with Amazon's perspective confirmed that Future presented this argument.  But the arbitrator ruled that ""economic hardship alone is not a legal ground for disregarding legal obligations,"" according to the order, Reuters reported. ""We welcome the award of the Emergency Arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.  CNN Business contacted Future Group for comment, and received a statement from Future Retail. Future Retail said it ""is examining the communication and the order"" from SIAC.  Reliance (RRVL) said in a statement that its deal with Future Retail is ""fully enforceable"" under Indian law.   ""RRVL intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay,"" said the statement. But in the past, Indian courts have usually followed the lead of orders passed by emergency arbitrators outside of India, according to Kabra, the lawyer. ""What parties have previously done, is they approach Indian Courts and ask for similar reliefs in India, while relying on the order of the Emergency Arbitrator. Indian Courts usually grant the same relief,"" said Kabra.  A 'clash of the titans' For Reliance, which operates 11,000 stores throughout India, and Amazon, the No. 2 e-commerce player in the country, Future Retail's 1,500 stores are not a must have, says one analyst. ""It's not like without it you can't have your ambitions, if you don't have Future [Retail],"" said Pathak, of Counterpoint Research.  This is ""less about Future and more about the clash of the titans,"" as well as ""protecting your turf,"" he added.  To compete with Amazon and Flipkart, Ambani's JioMart has been growing its presence in India. It expanded to hundreds of cities across India earlier this year and plans to branch into electronics, fashion, pharmaceutical and healthcare soon. The company will also likely tap into Reliance Retail's network of physical stores across the country to fulfill online orders, according to analysts.  The industry had expected Amazon and Reliance to forge some kind of deal in the future, because they need each other's expertise, according to Meena, of Forrester. Amazon needs more shops to expand inventory and use retail spaces as storage and delivery hubs. And Reliance doesn't have a lot of experience in e-commerce, according to Meena. But any kind of partnership between Amazon and Reliance in the future ""depends upon how much bad blood is between them now,"" said Meena.  ""It might end up becoming an ego battle between the CEOs of both the companies,"" he said. "
25,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/success/motortrend-car-of-the-year-mercedes-e-class/index.html,MotorTrend Car of the Year goes to tech-heavy Mercedes E-Class,"The E-Class impressed MotorTrend's staffers with its mixture of classic luxury and modern, hi-tech performance, the magazine said in its announcement.  Mercedes' win was surprising because the E-Class was not a completely new design but rather what's known in the auto industry as a ""mid-cycle refresh."" Automakers usually release an all-new, completely redesigned version of a car model every five years or so. In between, they do a major update, usually altering the appearance somewhat and perhaps offering new engine options and making other underlying changes. In this case, Mercedes' reworking of the E-Class changed it from a good car to one with really outstanding performance, style and comfort, according to MotorTrend's staffers. A sophisticated optional air suspension system provides a smooth ride but also good cornering performance, staffers said. The interior design mixes modern looking screens and vents with classic wood and leather, the report said. Also surprising is the fact that this year's award was given to nearly every version of the car in the E-Class' current lineup. That includes the $54,000 Mercedes-Benz  E 350, with its small four-cylinder engine, the $112,500 Mercedes AMG E 63 S wagon with its 603-horsepower V8 and the two-door E-Class Cabriolet and Coupe. Both of the two-door models are also available in high-performance AMG versions. All versions of the car were, surprisingly, very good, according to MotorTrend. Usually, with that many widely different variations, at least some would fall flat, MotorTrend judges said. MotorTrend staffers were particularly impressed with the E-Class's driver assistance technologies, including its automatic braking function. Automatic braking, which will brake if the driver doesn't respond quickly enough to a car stopping ahead, is common in new cars today. But Mercedes' system also stops for cars and pedestrians during turning maneuvers, something most others don't.. The E-Class also has side blind spot detection, another assistance feature that's commonly available on new cars. But Mercedes' system warns of cars and bicyclists that are approaching when the car is stopped and someone is about to open a door. One technology feature that did not impress the automotive media company's staffers was the user interface system for drivers and passengers. The system can be operated by touching the display screen, using the touch-sensitive pad between the seats, sliding a thumb across tiny touch sensitive panels on the steering wheel or using voice commands.  Using the system caused the driver to take their eyes off the road too often, according to MotorTrend's staffers. And the car's various functions required going through too many menus while the system's responses to inputs, particularly from the steering wheel controls, were inconsistent, they said. MotorTrend Group, which encompasses the print magazine, web site and video outlets, gives out annual awards for Car of The Year, SUV of the Year and Truck of the Year. The Land Rover Defender was named SUV of the Year in October, while the Truck of the Year has not been announced yet. To be eligible for the Car of the Year Award, a model line must be either all new or substantially changed for the 2021 model year. "
26,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/business/freshdirect-ahold-delhaize-stop-and-shop/index.html,A Dutch grocery giant is buying FreshDirect,"The two companies announced the agreement Wednesday, but did not disclose terms of the transaction. The deal is expected to close next year. FreshDirect will retain its name and continue to operate out of New York City, where it was launched in 2002. Ahold Delhaize (ADRNY), which was formed in 2016 from a merger of Ahold and Delhaize Group, is one of the largest grocery operators in the United States. It said that FreshDirect will help it reach new customers and drive sales in the lucrative New York market. FreshDirect said gaining access to the Dutch company's size and scale will allow it to grow. ""Ahold is determined to get bigger to compete with the heavyweights like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT),"" Jon Springer, executive editor of Winsight Grocery Business, an industry trade publication, wrote in an email. ""FreshDirect gets a parent with real buying power and the means to further expand in East Coast markets."" The agreement comes at a moment when the pandemic has reshaped the grocery industry. Leading grocers such as Kroger (KR), Albertsons, Publix and others have logged booming sales in stores and online as consumers eat more food at home with restaurants shuttered and many people skittish about going out for dinner.  Ahold's US sales at stores open for at least one year grew 12.4%, excluding gasoline, during its most recent quarter compared with the same stretch last year, the company said earlier this month. Online sales increased 114.7%. The company said the growth was ""due largely to the COVID-19 outbreak."" Shopping for groceries online had been slower to develop in the United States than buying electronics, clothing and other goods, but the coronavirus has prompted a surge of new customers with shoppers looking to limit their trips to physical stores. ""Covid was kind of a wake-up call for us,"" Ahold chief financial officer Natalie Knight told The Wall Street Journal in August. Brick-and-mortar grocers and online delivery services have strained to keep pace with demand, leading to canceled orders and lengthy delays for customers.  FreshDirect was not staffed to handle the flood of orders from existing customers and shoppers when the pandemic first hit, CEO David McInerney told CNN Business in an interview last month. ""The barriers to online grocery got absolutely obliterated"" in March, he said. ""We couldn't take"" the surge in demand. The company's systems were overwhelmed because people were buying two and three times as much per order as they typically did, buying for a longer period of time than usual and ordering for friends and relatives. Fresh Direct has planned for a busy winter with coronavirus cases on the rise. It secured holiday items, such as canned pumpkin, baking supplies, and spices earlier than usual this year and is storing greater quantities of them in warehouses. ""We're expecting a really, really busy winter, and it's going to be filled with a lot of first time customers getting acclimated to online food buying,"" McInerney said last month. ""The colder weather is just going to push that along."""
